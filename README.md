- Took part in this 7-day general programming FACT trip to Petra Christian University (PCU) in Surabaya, Indonesia as part of the 10.020 Data Driven World module. Took part in the hackathon during the trip in a team of 6 (3 SUTD students and 3 PCU students) and achieved 1st Place (out of 10 teams)
- From the SUTD FACT Trips official website: 'FACT (Freshmore Asian Cross-curricular Trips) is a 1-week overseas immersion programme which enables Freshmore (first-year) students to build upon their acquired knowledge at our partner universities in Asia. Centered around specific Freshmore courses, FACT challenges students to apply what theyâ€™ve learned in the classroom to solving sustainability challenges within the region.'
- The challenge of this hackathon was to create a website application using Streamlit and machine learning to help local businesses (we visited a cafe, paving factory and farm) in Gunung Anyar, Surabaya, Indonesia
- Created a functional prototype Streamlit website application to help out a local farm business (particularly about finding the optimal conditions for hydroponic farming of spinaches), titled 'TaniBoss!' ('Tani' comes from 'Petani', which is Indonesian for 'Farmer'). It contains a simple prediction and farming conditions recommendation machine learning model to optimise crop yield, a forum for farmers, and PetaniAI, a large language model trained with hydroponic and general farming data (using Chatbase) to serve as a secondary expert. 
- Contributed to the problem statemenet formulation, design of the machine learning model, and development of the Streamlit website (including the forum and PetaniAI features)
